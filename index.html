  <p>This folder contains some p5.js files that might be of interest.  Included are some possibly
   useful programs, some demo files, and some some how-to files related to p5.js.</p>
  <p>The p5.js files have the file type .pjs.  My editor has special features for different languages.
   It determines the language based on the file type which makes it desirable to distinguish between
   true Javascript .js files and p5.js files. In order to do so, the file type .pjs is being used for p5.js files.
  </p>
  <p>The .pjs files assume the necessary p5.js include files are in "/p5js".  If you decide to copy the
   files to your own computer, you may have to edit the names of those files in the &lt;script&gt; section.

  <p class = "maroon">Not many options at this point.  Some more files should be coming soon.</p>
