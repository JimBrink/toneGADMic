<h1>ToneGAD<br>
      <span style="font-size:smaller">Tone Generator and Display</span></h1>
<p>I it is my hope that this sketch might be helpful to someone to better understand
  wave form physics and music.  Hopefully, it might encourage someone to investigate the
  concepts more carefully.</p>
<h2>A guided tour</h2>
<p> <button id= "tourButton" onclick='toggle(0)'>+/-</button>
  This section will acquaint you with the various controls.</p>
<!-- *************************** the tour ********************* -->
<div id = "tour" style = "display: none" class = "aDiv">
<h3>The Controls</h3>
<h4>Mode</h4>
<p>In the "Mode" panel there are three options:  "Off", "Tone" and "Piano".  The program
  starts with the "Off" mode and nothing happens until you select either the "Tone" or
  "Piano" mode.</p>
<p>In the "Tone" mode, a tone will start to immediately
  (assuming your speakers are on).   The tone can be controlled by
  the other controls.  To turn the tone off, switch to either the "Off" or "Piano" mode.
  In the "Piano" mode you will need to press certain keys in order to get a tone to play.</p>

<h4>Volume</h4>
<p>Things are more interesting, if you click the "Tone" box.  You can vary the volume with
  the "Volume"
  control either using the buttons whose notations are those used in music or with the slider.
  "pp" means very soft while "ff" means very load.
  The volume can range from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>The amount of tone you hear at various frequencies will depend on the quality of your
  sound generation system and speakers.  With my not very HiFi earphones, I can't hear
  frequencies below about 35 Hz and above about 7000 Hz.  Quality systems might do much
  better.  Good ears might hear frequencies up to about 20,000 Hz if the sound system will
  produce them.</p>
<h4>Frequency</h4
<p> Next move to the "Frequency" control which provides
  3 different ways to select the frequency or pitch. The higher the frequency, the higher pitch
  the sound seems to us. The top 4 buttons:
  <ul>
    <li>"100 Hz".  Hz stands for "Hertz" or "cycles per second".   The higher hertz, the higher
      pitch of the tone.  100 Hz was selected just because it is a convenient number.</li>
    <li>"Middle C".  This the pitch is Middle C on the piano.  It frequency shows in the
      display.</li>
    <li>"A":  Over the years, several different frequencies have been used for the key of
      A above middle C.  In 1926, the American music industry agreed to use 440 Hz for
      A.  It was adapted an international standard in 1955 although not every one agrees.
     Orchestras is the U.S. and U.K. normally tune their instruments to A pitched at 440 Hz.</li>
   <li>"B flat":  Most concert, marching, and brass bands tune on "B flat" which just a little
     higher than "A".  The reason:  many band instruments are pitched in B flat.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Just below the those buttons is a slider that allows adjusting the frequency anywhere
     between 50Hz and 2200Hz.</p>
  <p>Below them are 10 multiplier buttons which multiply the selected frequency by the
     indicated number. <i> (While initially exploring these buttons, it strongly suggested that you select
    "100 Hz" button.)</i> The default is "1". "2" multiplies the selected frequency by 2, "3" multiplies
    it by 3 and so on. The selected button is shown in "red".  In music, doubling the frequency
    increases the tone by 1 octave, reducing the tone by 1/2, lowers by 1 octave.  This makes
    the multipliers 1/4, 1/2, 2, 4, and 8 especially interesting as they can reduce the
    pitch by 2 octaves or 1 octave  or increase it by 1, 2 or 3 octaves.</p>
<h4>FFT and the two displays</h4>
 <p>In case you are wondering, "FFT" stands for "Fast Fourier Transform", a
     mathematical way of analyzing periodic (regularly repeating) functions.  But don't
     worry.  You not need to
     do any math.  But fortunately we can take advantage of its results.  (I was able
     to advantage of somebody else's coding and didn't have to do the code the
     mathematics!)
 <p>The upper display shows an image of the wave.  If the display seems to be too bouncy
    to understand, try clicking on of the "... times/sec" buttons.  Then the upper display will
    show a snap shot of the  wave which is updated the indicated number of times each
    second.  Assuming that the wave form is still a sine wave, you should see a nice image
    of the common sine wave if the frequency is somewhere between 100 Hz and 2000 Hz.
    Below that, you may see only part of one cycle, above that you may see a smear.</p>
   <p>You will the notice the width of a set of humps in the curve gets smaller as the
    frequency increases.</p>
  <p>If you are still displaying a sine wave, you will see a spike at the specified frequency
    in the lower display.
    (We will discuss this display again when we look at other wave forms.  It will be much
    more interesting then and the "Show peaks" check box may be useful at that point.)</p>
<h4>Wave Control</h4>
 <p>You are probably tried of listening to the sine wave.  So lets try some of the other
    options.  Looking at the wave forms in the upper display, you can easily understand
    the names for the triangle, saw tooth and square wave.  The later is the easiest to
    understand.  A square wave could be produced by just turning on and off an
    electrical circuit in a periodic fashion.  I am not sure how this program produces
    the wave because again I am taking advantage someone else's coding.  One could assume
    that the triangle and square wave could be produced by turning a voltage control
    up and down periodically but again I can't say how this program does it.</p>
  <p>The lower display becomes quite interesting with these wave forms.  <b>
    It will be easiest understand them if you set the frequency to 100 Hz and the
    multiplier to 10 giving a 1000 Hz  tone and turn on the "Show peaks" option  in the
    FFT display.</b>   If you look at the triangle or square wave forms, you will see
    peaks at  1000 Hz, 3000 Hz, 5000 Hz .... .  One the other hand, if you look at the
    sawtooth wave, you will see peaks at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, ... .  What gives?
  <p>
  <p>Comment:  Don't be disturbed that the frequencies in the "Show peak" display
    in the upper right corner of the lower display are not exactly those numbers.  The
    reason is that the analysis divides all the frequencies up to about 25,000 Hz into
    1024 "bins".  Each "bin" is about 24 Hz wide and the number report in the peak
    display is more or less an average for those frequencies.  So if the peak is reported
    by 1006 Hz, it means that the analysis saw a lot of frequencies near 1006  which
    would certainly include the 1000 Hz we expected see.  At high frequencies,
    having 24 Hz wide bins is not a major problem but it is when the frequencies
    are lower and the reported peaks will not be very accurate.</p>
  <p>Consider the saw tooth wave.  FFT reports that it would be possible to generate
    a saw tooth wave mixing waves the frequencies 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, ...,
    with the proper amplitudes together.  Notice these frequencies are all multiples
    of the base frequency 1000 Hz.  The height of the peak gives you some idea of the
    amplitude needed although some may actually be positive and some negative.  On
    the other hand, the triangle and square waves only use the odd (1,3. 5, 7, ...)
    multiples of 1000 Hz.  The even  (2,4, 6, 8, ...)multiples are not needed because of certain
    symmetry in the wave form.</p>
  <p>The peak frequencies that you see with these wave forms are sometimes called
    <b>harmonics</b> or <b>overtones</b>.  In the harmonics section we will discus
    why the musical notes we hear are effected by the harmonic the wave form
    generates even though nice musical tones rarely have the extreme shape of the
    three none-sine wave options.</p>

<h3>The Piano mode</h3>
<p>The piano mode allow you to individual play individual notes using keyboard keys
  To see the keys that work, just click the "Keys for Piano Note" button.  You will see
  there are two ways.  You can use the note names like "a", "b", ..., in lower case while
  capping a letter to gets you it sharp (for those keys that have sharps).  In some cases,
  it is more convenient to use the top row of keys on a standard keyboard which include
  the number keys.  The notes sound as long as you hold the key down.  Their
  (approximate) frequency shows in the Frequency control and the multipliers work
  in the normal fashion.  The Volume and Wave Form controls work as normal.</p>
<p>In attempt to mimic many instruments, notes are accented at lower volume levels
  when the notes starts and they decay slowly when the key is released.</p>

<h2>  How can harmonics be used to produce different pitches?</h2>

<p><button id = "brassButton" onclick='toggle(1)'>+/-</button>
    In this section, we will look at how brass instrument players take advantage of
   harmonics.  They can even be observed on some string instruments like a guitar.
</p>

<!-- *************************** the brass section ********************* -->
<div id = "brass" style = "display: none" class = "aDiv">

<p>Pianos, organs and woodwind instruments have lots of keys that allow the musician
   to play lots of different notes.  String instruments may have only 4 or  6 strings, but
   the player can press the string at various points to pick the desired frequency.
   But have you ever noticed that most brass instruments
   like trumpets and tubas typically only have three valves?  They can be used in
   combination but for practical purposes, there are are only 7 different combinations.
   How in the world can brass players produce lots of different notes? Typically, the
   length of the tubing determines the frequency of sound and the purpose of the
   valves is to change the length of the tubing.  The valves allow for 7 different
   tube lengths.  (Trombone players effectly only have the same 7
   options but they are able to adjust the slide in between those options.) How in the
   world can brass players produce lots of different notes? </p>
<!-- <p>Before answering the question, lets look at another situation.  Have you ever filled
   a bottle part full with water and then blown across the top
   of the bottle to get a tone?  If you have, you may have
   notice that you will get a particular sound frequency.  Want to change the frequency?
   You wil have to increase the amount of water to increase the frequency, decrease it to
   decrease the frequency.  The frequency depends on the air space in bottle.  Likewise
   a pipe organ or marimba have to have a lot of different length pipes to produce
   differnt sounds.</p> -->
<p>The answer is they use their
   lips to produce different harmonics.  It is something like selecting one of the
   multiplier buttons in the Frequency control.   Most players use there lips to produce
   harmonics (or multipiers) of  2, 3, ..., 6.  An excellent player (depending on the
   instrument) can pick harmonics from 1 to 8 or possibly even higher.  Harmonic 1,
   called the fundamental or petal tone, is often hard to produce.  Harmonics higher
   than 6  take lots of practice to control in a useful manner.</p>
<p>Lets  take a closer look at the trombone,  in part because I try to play one.  (The
  other part is the trumpet players actually play B flat when they call the note being played C
  which may be confusing.)
  Recall
   that we said the concert bands typically tune on B flat because most band
   instruments are pitched in B
   flat.  Trombones are pitched in in that key.  If the trombone players leave the slide
   all the way closed, they can play
   harmonics based on B flat.  (Trumpets can get the same effect if they leave all
   their valves up only they are an octive higher because their tubing is only half as long.
   But for reasons that muscians can only understand, they call it C.)  Lets
   look carefully at the harmonics of a trombone with the slide closed.
<ul>
  <li>1st harmonic, multiplier 1:  a low B flat two measures below Middle C on the
     piano but remember it normally very hard to play.  It is sometimes called the
     fundamental or petal note.</li>
   <li>2nd harmonic, multiplier 2:  Remember that multipier 2 produces a tone one octive
     higher, so it is also B flat, one otave below middle C.</li>
   <li>3rd harmonic, multipier 3:  F below middle C</li>
   <li>4th harmonic, multiplier 4:  As we know, this is 1 octave above the 2nd harmonic so
       it is the B flat just below middle C.</li>
   <li>5th harmonic, multiplier 5:  D just above middle C.</li>
   <li>6th harmonic, multiplier 6:  6 is twice 3, so this another F, this time above middle C.</li>
   <li>7th harmonic, multiplier 7:  A rather flat A flat so it is not normally used on a
     trombone and almost never on other brass instruments with valves.</li>
    <li>8th harmonic, multiplier 8:  8 is twice 4.  So can you guess that it is also a B flat,
    an octave above middle C.  Typically only expert players can produce this harmonic
    well enough to play it a concert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exactly the same concepts apply to baratones and
   euphoniams. while a Double B flat tubas plays one octave lower. Trumpet players play
    the same notes but because their tubing is only half as long,
   the notes are an octave higher.  (Remember that for musical reasons understood by
   trumptet players, the would call the harmonics C, C, G, C, E, G, a flat B flat that would
   almost never be used, and C.  The french horn,
   alto horn (also called tenor horn, E flat horn, or althorn), and the E flat tuba are pitched
   differently and have different fundamentals but the harmonics work the same
   way.</p>
<div class = "floatRight"><img src = "Images/VibratingString.png" alt="Vibrating strings"></div>
<p>We have discussed these harmonics on brass instruments, but they also apply
   to stringed instruments like a guitar.  Have you ever looked closely at thicker,
   heavier lower note string vibrate?  If you have, you will notice that it vibrates with
   the shape similar to the top half of a sine wave.  To play a note one octave higher,
   guitar players press string at the half way point and only half the string vibrates.
   But if the one very gently touches the string at the half point, the first harmonic is
   suppressed and one may see
   both halves of the string vibrate - the string is now vibrating in two sections - the second
   harmonic.  In theory, we could try gently touching string 1/3 of the way down.  This
   would mean neither the first or 2 second harmonic could sound and the string would
   be vibrating in 3 sections producing the 3 harmonic.</p>
<p>You may wonder how the harmonics work in brass instruments.  The following is
   a very simple minded explaination.  Playing harmonic 1 means
   that one peri od of the sine wave uses the entire length of the pipe.  When  brass
   players users use their lips to play the 2nd harmonic, they are effectively getting the
   instrument to vibrate in two sections in much the same manner as we were able
   to produce the second harmonic on the guitar.  If they play the 3rd harmonic, they
   are getting
   instrument to vibrate in three sections and so on.  Fortunately, their harmonics can be
   played usefully and loadly on brass instruments although they would be quite soft
   on the guitar.</p>

<h2>How can harmonics help music enhance music?</h2>

<!-- ********************* harmonics enhance section ***************** -->
<p> <button id= "enhanceButton" onclick='toggle(2)'>+/-</button>
  Harmonics which are often call overtones in this contex, are important in making
  music enjoyable to listen to.
</p>
<div id = "enhance" style = "display: none" class = "aDiv">

<p>In the previous section we looked at how harmonics can be used to produce
  different pitches especially in brass instruments.  In this section we will look at how
  harmonics, normally referred to as <b>overtones</b> in this context enhance almost
  all music.  Harmonics (or overtones) help explain why a trumpet sounds different
  than a violin or flute even they are holding on the same note.</p>
<p>Did you find that sine wave sound boring?  They are just too pure.  If you played
  much in the piano mode on this program, you might have found yourself preferring
  to use one of the other wave forms even though they are not really nice sounding.
  Even the human voice is enriched by harmonics.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we spent a little time discussing how harmonics could be
  produced on a guitar.  Actually, even when a player is playing a certain note, there
  will be small amounts of higher harmonics occurring at the same time.  Even though
  we may think we are only hearing the first harmonic or fundamental, it is the harmonics
  that help the note to sound pleasing to us instead of being a boring sine wave.</p>
<div class = "floatRight"><img src = "Images/trumpetVariations.png"
            alt="Cornet, trumpet, flugalhorn"></div>
<h4>Trumpets, cornets, and flugalhorns</h4>
<p>As the first example, we are going to look at trumpets, cornets, and flugalhorns.
  If you are not familiar with these instruments, you might want to look at the video
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfGM19bsmM">
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfGM19bsmM</a> where the presenter
   compares these instruments and there sound.
  The typical versions of these instruments are all pitched in B flat and have the
  same valving.  Plays can move from one of the instruments to the other without
  much difficulty although a player may specialize in just one of them.  One the other
  hand, perhaps you may have seen trumpet players switch to the flugalhorn in the
  middle of the piece.  Why would they do that?  The answer is they have a different
  sound.  But why do they sound different even when they play the same note?  The
  answer is they produce different harmonic or overtones.  The tubes in a trumpet are
  straighter and have a smaller diameter.  That means that the higher harmonics, though
  small, are more pronounced giving the trumpet a more piecing tone.  On the other had, the
  rounder, somewhat larger diameter tubes in the flugalhorn give it a mellower tone with
  less of the higher harmonics.
  The cornet might be considered an compromise between those two extremes.
<div class = "floatRight"><img src="Images/PipeOrganPipes.png"
    alt = "Pipe ranks in a pipe organ"></div>
<h4>Pipe organs</h4>
<p>As seen in the picture at the right, larger pipe organs often have several different
  kinds of pipes. There are multiple pipes of each style as they needed produce different
  pitches.  This organ has both square and trianglar shaped wood pipes as well
  metal pipes of different shapes.  Why? The different materials and shapes produce
  sound with differing amounts of harmonics or overtones.  As a result, the sound
  coming from the different style of pipes has a different tonal quality even when
  they are playing the same note.</p>
